Data Visualization project for Udacity Data Analyst course.

## Summary

On Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending platform, investors can choose among personal loans requested by borrowers to invest in, considering credit scores, ratings, among other factors, which include a custom calculated *Prosper Score* that represents the risk for each loan. The higher the risk, the higher the interest rates paid by the borrower to the investors.

However, this visualization shows that, on average, loans with a *Prosper Score* of 2-4 (higher risk) had similar proportions of bad loans (defaulted loans, charged off loans or loans past due) as loans with a score of 6-8 (lower risk), even though their interest rate was significantly higher. In other words, investors who invested in loans with a score of 6-8 expected lower risk loans — and received lower rates in return — but ended up with risky loans just the same.
